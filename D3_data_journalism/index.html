          <h3>Correlations Between Poverty and Healthcare</h3>
          <p>Research has shown a link between poverty and poor health.  
            We know that 18.5% of the U.S. non-elderly population does not have health insurance, 
            with low-income families especially vulnerable to being uninsured. Nearly 70% of the uninsured 
            population is poor or near-poor.

          <h3>Correlations Between Age and Smoking</h3>
          <p>Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States, 
            accounting for more than 480,000 deaths every year, or about 1 in 5 deaths.  In 2019, nearly 14 of every 100 U.S. 
            adults aged 18 years or older (14.0%) currently* smoked cigarettes.  Current cigarette smoking was highest among 
            people aged 25–44 years and 45–64 years. Current cigarette smoking was lowest among people aged 18-24 years.  
            *Current smokers are defined as people who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who, 
            at the time they participated in a survey about this topic, reported smoking every day or some days.
